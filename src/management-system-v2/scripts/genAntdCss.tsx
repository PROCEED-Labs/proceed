/**
 * Generate a static Antd CSS file.
 *
 * This script is used to generate an Antd CSS file for NextJS to use in the
 * HTML head. Otherwise, the SSR Antd components on initial load would have no
 * style, since they use css-in-js which has no effect in SSR. Other solutions
 * are possible, but this is the only one that allows the user to cache the CSS
 * file. Style injection would quickly bloat the page size and slow hydration.
 *
 * See: https://ant.design/docs/react/customize-theme#server-side-render-ssr
